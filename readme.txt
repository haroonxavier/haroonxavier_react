ASSUMPTIONS

--The filter behavior is a bit odd. Clicking the city/country should show properties for that city/country

-- On clicking Sydney for example I am removing only Sydney from the results even though in the document it says to remove Melbourne as well. Didn't't make sense to do that

-- Only added the click event on the View on Map button. Didn't make sense to add the same function for products button

-- Clicking on the the button instead of displaying the text of the button clicked, I am displaying a bigger image and the name of the property as that would be more useful then the text of the button.

-- Since the background is white, I am not doing to display a white text. It will be hard to see that...

-- Didn't write the change handler for search input as it is not being used.
